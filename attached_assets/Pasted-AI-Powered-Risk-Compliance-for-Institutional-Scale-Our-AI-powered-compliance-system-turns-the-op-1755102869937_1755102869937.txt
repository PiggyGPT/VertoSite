AI-Powered Risk & Compliance for Institutional Scale.

Our AI-powered compliance system turns the open blockchain into a regulator-ready operational backbone. It replaces manual, multi-week reviews with continuous, auditable automation, allowing you to safely accept funds and trade stablecoins for other assets, all while scaling without sacrificing compliance or speed.

How We Ensure Safe Operations

Our system integrates directly into your business logic, ensuring every transaction—from a cash deposit to a payment—is compliant from the start.
* Explainable Risk Ratings: Our AI generates clear, Moody's-style risk scores for wallets, tokens, and protocols. This model is fully transparent, providing the data lineage and rationale behind every score. This lets you confidently set and enforce your institutional risk policies, knowing who you're accepting funds from.
* Policy-Driven Routing: Define your compliance policies once. Our system automatically enforces them by routing payments and trades to balance risk, latency, and slippage. You can confidently accept funds from any wallet and trade stablecoins through compliant routes.

Auditability and Oversight

We provide the tools needed to satisfy regulators and build an ironclad audit trail.
* Real-Time Audit Trails: Every decision, from a route choice to a counterparty approval, is logged in a time-stamped provenance. This record is human-readable and cryptographically verifiable, making audit preparation a matter of minutes, not months.
* Operational Controls: Automate approvals, overrides, whitelists/blacklists, and escalation paths directly into your compliance dashboards. This gives your team deterministic controls to manage exceptions and maintain oversight.

Key Benefits: What We Secure

Our compliance system is designed with a risk-first approach, providing a verifiable layer of security for every core operation.
* Minting & On-Ramps: We ensure compliant cash-to-stablecoin minting by enforcing KYC and AML policies at the point of cash-in. Every mint event is recorded in a verifiable audit trail.
* Payments: Our system securely accepts payments from any wallet on any chain. All payment routes are evaluated against your compliance policies in real-time.
* Trading: We facilitate compliant trading of stablecoins to and from any digital asset on any chain through our policy-driven routing.
