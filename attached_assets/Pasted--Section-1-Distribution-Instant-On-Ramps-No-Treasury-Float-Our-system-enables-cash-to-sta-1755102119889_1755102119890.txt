Section 1: Distribution





Instant On-Ramps. No Treasury Float.



Our system enables cash-to-stablecoin minting at any point of value-in. We empower Agent Partners—from retail kiosks to mobile operators—to serve as cash-in points for your stablecoin.



How It Works: The Agent Onboarding Flow



Agent Experience



Pre-fund: The agent establishes a deposit-backed credit line with you.

Create QR: The agent enters a cash amount on their terminal or app, instantly generating a unique QR code against their credit line.

Customer Experience



Deposit & Scan: The customer hands over cash and scans the QR code.

Confirm: A single tap confirms the transaction. Wallet creation and minting happen simultaneously, gas-free, ensuring a seamless experience.

What We Do Behind the Scenes



Full Stack Integration: Our SDK embeds into terminals and apps, connecting to bank/cash APIs and your funding/reconciliation systems for real-time reconciliation.

Orchestration: We create the deposit-backed credit token and link it to the single-use QR code.

Compliance & Audit: Our platform enforces real-time KYC, counterparty limits, and records a cryptographic audit trail for every mint event.



Key Benefits





Mass Adoption: Scale distribution by leveraging existing retail networks.

Zero Float: Stablecoins are minted on-demand, eliminating the need for a massive, pre-funded treasury.

Low Cost: Integrate with existing infrastructure, requiring no costly new hardware.





Section 2: Payments





One-Tap Payments. Universal Acceptance.



Our payment stack removes all blockchain friction from the checkout process. A single API integration lets Merchant Partners accept payments from any wallet, credit card, or exchange—from any chain and with any token.



How It Works: The Merchant Payment Flow



Merchant Experience



Integrate Once: A single API connects to the merchant's web, POS, or mobile app.

Create Link: The system instantly generates a dynamic QR code or payment link.

Receive Funds: Funds are instantly routed and settled.

Customer Experience



Tap to Pay: The user scans the QR or clicks the payment link.

Universal Funding: They pay with their preferred method (any token, any chain) with a single tap.

No Gas Fees: We sponsor gas fees on every chain, making the experience truly seamless.

What We Do Behind the Scenes



Payment Orchestration: Our system handles the entire payment journey, including instant routing, cross-chain conversions, and gas-free execution. This ensures a seamless flow from the user's payment to the merchant's settlement with automated reconciliation.

Non-Custodial: We never hold user funds, maintaining a secure and trustless system.

Compliance & Audit: All payment routes and conversions are evaluated against your compliance policies in real-time. This ensures every transaction is safe and fully auditable from end to end.



Key Benefits





Boost Conversion: A one-tap user experience and sponsored gas fees drive higher completion rates.

Drive Adoption: A single API opens merchants to a universal payment ecosystem.

Automated Back-Office: We handle reconciliation, chargebacks, and reporting, saving time and money.



Section 3: Compliance





AI-Powered Risk & Compliance for Institutional Scale.



Our AI-powered compliance system turns the open blockchain into a regulator-ready operational backbone. It replaces manual, multi-week reviews with continuous, auditable automation, allowing you to safely accept funds and trade stablecoins for other assets, all while scaling without sacrificing compliance or speed.



How We Ensure Safe Operations



Our system integrates directly into your business logic, ensuring every transaction—from a cash deposit to a payment—is compliant from the start.



Explainable Risk Ratings: Our AI generates clear, Moody's-style risk scores for wallets, tokens, and protocols. This model is fully transparent, providing the data lineage and rationale behind every score. This lets you confidently set and enforce your institutional risk policies, knowing who you're accepting funds from.

Policy-Driven Routing: Define your compliance policies once. Our system automatically enforces them by routing payments and trades to balance risk, latency, and slippage. You can confidently accept funds from any wallet and trade stablecoins through compliant routes.



Auditability and Oversight



We provide the tools needed to satisfy regulators and build an ironclad audit trail.



Real-Time Audit Trails: Every decision, from a route choice to a counterparty approval, is logged in a time-stamped provenance. This record is human-readable and cryptographically verifiable, making audit preparation a matter of minutes, not months.

Operational Controls: Automate approvals, overrides, whitelists/blacklists, and escalation paths directly into your compliance dashboards. This gives your team deterministic controls to manage exceptions and maintain oversight.



Key Benefits: What We Secure



Our compliance system is designed with a risk-first approach, providing a verifiable layer of security for every core operation.



Minting & On-Ramps: We ensure compliant cash-to-stablecoin minting by enforcing KYC and AML policies at the point of cash-in. Every mint event is recorded in a verifiable audit trail.

Payments: Our system securely accepts payments from any wallet on any chain. All payment routes are evaluated against your compliance policies in real-time.

Trading: We facilitate compliant trading of stablecoins to and from any digital asset on any chain through our policy-driven routing.
