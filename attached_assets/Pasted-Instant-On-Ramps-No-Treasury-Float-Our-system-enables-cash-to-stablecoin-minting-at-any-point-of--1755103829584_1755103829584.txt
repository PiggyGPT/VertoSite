Instant On-Ramps. No Treasury Float.

Our system enables cash-to-stablecoin minting at any point of value-in. We empower Agent Partners—from retail kiosks to mobile operators—to serve as cash-in points for your stablecoin.

How It Works: The Agent Onboarding Flow

Agent Experience
* Pre-fund: The agent establishes a deposit-backed credit line with you.
* Create QR: The agent enters a cash amount on their terminal or app, instantly generating a unique QR code against their credit line.
Customer Experience
* Deposit & Scan: The customer hands over cash and scans the QR code.
* Confirm: A single tap confirms the transaction. Wallet creation and minting happen simultaneously, gas-free, ensuring a seamless experience.
What We Do Behind the Scenes
* Full Stack Integration: Our SDK embeds into terminals and apps, connecting to bank/cash APIs and your funding/reconciliation systems for real-time reconciliation.
* Orchestration: We create the deposit-backed credit token and link it to the single-use QR code.
* Compliance & Audit: Our platform enforces real-time KYC, counterparty limits, and records a cryptographic audit trail for every mint event.

Key Benefits

* Mass Adoption: Scale distribution by leveraging existing retail networks.
* Zero Float: Stablecoins are minted on-demand, eliminating the need for a massive, pre-funded treasury.
* Low Cost: Integrate with existing infrastructure, requiring no costly new hardware.


Section 2: Payments


One-Tap Payments. Universal Acceptance.

Our payment stack removes all blockchain friction from the checkout process. A single API integration lets Merchant Partners accept payments from any wallet, credit card, or exchange—from any chain and with any token.

How It Works: The Merchant Payment Flow

Merchant Experience
* Integrate Once: A single API connects to the merchant's web, POS, or mobile app.

* Receive Funds: Funds are instantly routed and settled.
Customer Experience
* Tap to Pay: The user scans the QR or clicks the payment link.
* Universal Funding: They pay with their preferred method (any token, any chain) with a single tap.
* No Gas Fees: We sponsor gas fees on every chain, making the experience truly seamless.
What We Do Behind the Scenes
* Payment Orchestration: Our system handles the entire payment journey, including instant routing, cross-chain conversions, and gas-free execution. This ensures a seamless flow from the user's payment to the merchant's settlement with automated reconciliation.
* Non-Custodial: We never hold user funds, maintaining a secure and trustless system.
* Compliance & Audit: All payment routes and conversions are evaluated against your compliance policies in real-time. This ensures every transaction is safe and fully auditable from end to end.

Key Benefits

* Boost Conversion: A one-tap user experience and sponsored gas fees drive higher completion rates.
