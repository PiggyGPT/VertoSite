Section 1 — Distribution
Subtitle: Instant, on-demand minting where value is deposited — no pre-funded treasury required.
Layout: Left column = copy; Right column = GIF (bank/kiosk → stablecoin minted → user wallet)

Body (left):
A global distribution layer that mints your stablecoin at the point of value-in. Embed the OS directly into banks, retail kiosks, and agent networks so tokens are created only when and where they’re needed — eliminating treasury float and unlocking vast retail reach. Built with risk discipline informed by former Federal Reserve regulators, this flow scales safely into new markets.

Key elements (short bullets):

Mint-on-demand at partner touchpoints (banks, kiosks, agents)

Integrates with existing rails — no costly hardware or centralized pre-funding

Risk-first controls at distribution: KYC gating, deposit-backed issuance, and counterparty limits

SDKs & partner playbooks for quick rollout

Outcomes / CTA:
Unlock mass distribution • Eliminate treasury float • Slash on-ramp cost

Section 2 — Payments
Subtitle: One-tap payments that make merchants and users love your coin.
Layout: Left column = copy; Right column = GIF (customer tap → backend routing → merchant settled)

Body (left):
A universal payment stack that removes blockchain friction at checkout. One integration lets merchants accept your stablecoin from any wallet, exchange, or bank — with instant routing, reconciliation automation, and the UX consumers expect. Designed by teams that scaled crypto P2P to tens of millions, the stack prioritizes conversion and reliability over complexity.

Key elements (short bullets):

Single plug-and-play merchant integration (web + POS + mobile)

One-tap UX across wallets, CEXs, and bank rails

Smart routing & reconciliation: automatic settlement, chargeback handling, and reporting

Merchant dashboard with settlement guarantees and payout options

Outcomes / CTA:

Section 3 — Compliance (AI)
Subtitle: An institutional control tower — real-time, explainable compliance across any public chain.
Layout: Left column = copy; Right column = GIF (multi-chain transactions traced → single clean report). Include small CTA below GIF: “Free Risk & Compliance Review →”

Body (left):
Verto’s AI turns the open blockchain into a regulator-ready operational backbone. Continuous, auditable automation replaces manual, multi-week reviews with explainable risk signals and deterministic controls — so you can safely access public liquidity without sacrificing compliance or speed.

Core capabilities (short bullets):

Explainable Risk Ratings: AI-generated Moody’s-style scores for wallets, tokens, and protocols — fully transparent with data lineage, model rationale, and configurable risk appetites.

Policy-Driven Routing: Route trades and payments by balancing risk, latency, and slippage. Routes are evaluated against your policy engine, custodian-key signed, and executed with sponsored gas when required.

Real-Time Audit Trails: End-to-end, time-stamped provenance for every risk decision, route choice, and counterparty approval — human-readable and cryptographically verifiable for auditors and regulators.

Operational Controls: Automated approvals, overrides, whitelists/blacklists, and escalation paths integrated into compliance workflows and dashboards.

Outcomes / Trust signals:

CISO Trust: Continuous monitoring and explainable controls simplify security sign-offs.

Regulatory Approval: Turn weeks of evidence collection into minutes of automated, regulator-ready reports.

User Delight: Fewer failed transactions and smarter routing deliver a better customer experience without compromising safety.
