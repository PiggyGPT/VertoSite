# Static Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Build Command Added**: The project now has a proper build script that generates static files  
✅ **Static Files Generated**: Build process creates `index.html` and assets in the `dist` directory  
✅ **Correct Directory Structure**: Files are properly organized for static deployment  
✅ **Asset Paths Fixed**: All CSS and JS assets have correct relative paths  

## Deployment Steps

### For Manual Deployment:

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Prepare static deployment structure:**
   ```bash
   ./build-static.sh
   ```
   
   OR manually:
   ```bash
   cp -r dist/public/* dist/
   rm -rf dist/public
   ```

3. **Deploy on Replit:**
   - Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
   - Select "Static" deployment type
   - Set public directory to `dist`
   - Deploy!

### For Automated Deployment:

You can now use the included `build-static.sh` script that:
- Runs the full build process
- Copies files to the correct location for static deployment
- Cleans up unnecessary directories
- Provides deployment-ready output

## Verification

The `dist/` directory now contains:
- ✅ `index.html` (main entry point)
- ✅ `assets/` (compiled CSS and JS)
- ✅ `logos/` (static assets)

All file paths in the HTML are correctly set for static serving.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Verify `dist/index.html` exists
2. Check that all assets in `/assets/` are accessible
3. Ensure no absolute paths reference localhost or development servers
4. Consider using "Autoscale" deployment if static deployment continues to have issues
