## Deployment Configuration

### Static Deployment Fix (August 17, 2025)
- **Issue**: Replit static deployment failed due to missing `index.html` in `dist/` root directory
- **Root Cause**: Vite configuration outputs files to `dist/public/` instead of `dist/`
- **Solution**: Created deployment workflow that copies built files from `dist/public/` to `dist/` root
- **Files Added**:
  - `build-static.sh`: Automated script for preparing static deployment structure
  - `DEPLOYMENT_README.md`: Comprehensive deployment guide with troubleshooting
- **Current Structure**: Static files now properly located in `dist/` for Replit deployment
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` generates files, manual copy step required for deployment
