## Deployment Configuration

### Production Build Setup
- **Build Script**: `npm run build` - Builds both frontend (Vite) and backend (esbuild) for production
- **Start Script**: `npm start` - Runs the production server using the compiled output
- **Production Bundle**: Backend compiled to `dist/index.js` with external packages bundled appropriately

### Deployment Notes
- The project includes production-ready scripts in package.json
- Frontend built with Vite optimization for production assets
- Backend bundled with esbuild for Node.js production environment
- Environment variables properly configured for production deployment

### Deployment Fix Required (January 2025)
- **Issue**: Replit deployment blocked due to .replit file using development command (`npm run dev`)
- **Root Cause**: The .replit file deployment configuration points to development script instead of production
- **Manual Fix Required**: Update the .replit file deployment section:
  ```
  [deployment]
  deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
  run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build && npm start"]
  ```
- **Additional Workflow Fix**: Update the workflow task in .replit from `npm run dev` to production command if needed for deployment
- **Status**: Requires manual update to .replit file - agent cannot modify this file directly
